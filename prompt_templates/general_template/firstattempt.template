We now predict the sensor reading for {channel_info}. The historical data in kWh is as follows:

{x_table}

The historical weather condition is as follows:

{x_dy_table}

We now have the weather forecasting for the following days:

{y_dy_table}

Please format your forecasting in json format in [forecast_timestamp, predicted_value] pair. **Use the timestamp yyyymmddHHMMSS**. The predicted_value should be non-negtive float, it can be 0 when no power generate or the sensor/system is shutdown, sensor down means the system is down so no power generate. The json format is as follows with timestamp to forecast prefilled:

```json

{y_timestamp}

```

Now do the analysis step by step, you can think as long as you need. Finally, MAKE SURE YOUR FINAL PREDICTION ALIGNS WITH YOUR ANALYSIS.
